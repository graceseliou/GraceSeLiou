# Hi, I'm Grace ! 🌺🎧🍙 #

🌟 I'm a first-year Enterprise Technology Integration student at Penn State learning Java and SQL. I also plan on learning Python and HTML.

  * Reach out to me on LinkedIn
* I'm looking to collaborate with other beginners on VSCode projects.

🎡 My interests outside of the business technology industry include music, art, and seeing the implementation of creativity and diverse perspectivese around me. 

* Ask me about my spotify playlist names!
